# Learning Azure DevOps

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

My first Azure DevOps git repo: <https://dev.azure.com/hchiam/_git/test-azure-devops-project>

You can set up automated tests, just like Travis CI on GitHub: use Pipelines, select a template, and it'll run automatically. For example:

- <https://dev.azure.com/hchiam/_git/code-inspiration?path=%2Fazure-pipelines.yml>
- <https://dev.azure.com/hchiam/code-inspiration/_build/results?buildId=3&view=logs&j=12f1170f-54f2-53f3-20dd-22fc7dff55f9>
- <https://dev.azure.com/hchiam/code-inspiration/_build>

Another example:

- <https://github.com/hchiam/react-app>
- <https://dev.azure.com/hchiam/react-app/_build/results?buildId=11&view=logs&j=275f1d19-1bd8-5591-b06b-07d489ea915a>
- <https://dev.azure.com/hchiam/react-app/_releaseProgress?_a=release-pipeline-progress&releaseId=1>
